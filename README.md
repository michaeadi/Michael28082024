## Introduction

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide for setting up Mobile tests using Katalon Studio, connecting your project to GitHub, and integrating CircleCI for continuous integration and automated testing.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Katalon Studio (https://katalon.com/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [CircleCI Account](https://circleci.com/)


## Writing Test Cases

1. **Create a Collection in Katalon Studio:**
   - Launch Katalon Studio and create a new collection.
   - Add your Mobile test requests to this collection.

2. **Create a Test Suite:**
   - Add all the test in order of how you want the test to run
   - Push to the repo using git
  
## Setting Up GitHub

1. **Create a New Repository:**
   - Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/michaeadi/Michael28082024.git
     ```

2. **Add Your Project Files:**
   - Copy your Postman collection and environment files to the cloned repository.
   - Create a `.gitignore` file and add any files or directories you want to exclude from version control.

3. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   - Stage and commit your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit with Postman collection and environment"
     ```
   - Push the changes to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

## Integrating CircleCI

1. **Create a CircleCI Configuration File:**
   - In your project root, create a directory named `.circleci`.
   - Inside this directory, create a `config.yml` file with the following content:

2. **Push the CircleCI Config to GitHub:**
   - Stage, commit, and push your `.circleci/config.yml` file:
     ```bash
     git add .circleci/config.yml
     git commit -m "Add CircleCI configuration"
     git push origin main
     ```

3. **Set Up CircleCI:**
   - Log in to [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and select **Projects** from the sidebar.
   - Find your GitHub repository and click **Set Up Project**.
   - CircleCI will automatically detect your `.circleci/config.yml` file and begin running your tests.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### File Not Found Errors
Ensure the paths to your Katalon collection and environment files are correct in the CircleCI configuration.

### Failing Test Cases
Check your Katalon studio test scripts for any assertion errors. Review the CircleCI logs for detailed error messages.

## Conclusion

You have now set up a complete CI pipeline for Mobile testing using Katalon studio, GitHub, and CircleCI. This process ensures that your Mobile tests are automatically executed whenever changes are made to your codebase, helping maintain the integrity and reliability of your Test.
